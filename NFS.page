Enable NFS:

    <?=mk_option($var['shareNFSEnabled'], "no", "No");?>
    <?=mk_option($var['shareNFSEnabled'], "yes", "Yes");?>
    </select>

    > Select 'Yes' to enable the NFS protocol.

Tunable (fuse_remember):

:   <input type="text" name="fuse_remember" maxlength="10" value="<?=$var['fuse_remember'];?>"><?=$var['fuse_remember_status'];?>

    > When NFS is enabled, this Tunable may be used to alleviate or solve instances of "NFS Stale File Handles"
    > you might encounter with your NFS client.
    > 
    > In essence, (fuse_remember) tells an internal subsystem (named "fuse") how long to "remember" or "cache"
    > file and directory information associated with user shares.  When an NFS client attempts to access a file
    > (or directory) on the server, and that file (or directory) name is not cached, then you could encounter
    > "stale file handle".
    > 
    > The numeric value of this tunable is the number of seconds to cache file/directory name entries,
    > where the default value of 330 indicates 5 1/2 minutes.  There are two special values you may also set
    > this to:
    > 
    > * 0 which means, do not cache file/directory names at all, and
    > * -1 which means cache file/directory names forever (or until array is stopped)
    > 
    > A value of 0 would be appropriate if you are enabling NFS but only plan to use it for disk shares,
    > not user shares.
    > 
    > A value of -1 would be appropriate if no other timeout seems to solve the "stale file handle" on
    > your client.  Be aware that setting a value of -1 will cause the memory footprint to grow by approximatel
    > 108 bytes per file/directory name cached.  Depending how much RAM is installed in your server and how many
    > files/directories you access via NFS this may or may not lead to out-of-memory conditions.
