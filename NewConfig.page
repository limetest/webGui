This is a utility to reset the array disk configuration so that all disks appear as "New" disks, as
if it were a fresh new server.

This is useful when you have added or removed multiple drives and wish to rebuild parity based on
the new configuration.

**DO NOT USE THIS UTILITY THINKING IT WILL REBUILD A FAILED DRIVE** - it will have the opposite
effect of making it ***impossible*** to rebuild an existing failed drive - you have been warned!

<form markdown="1" name="newConfig" method="POST" action="/update.htm" target="progressFrame">

<? if ($var['fsState']=="Started"): ?>
      <input type="submit" name="cmdInit" value="Apply" disabled>Array must be Stopped
<? else: ?>
      <p class="Confirm"><input type="submit" name="cmdInit" value="Apply" disabled><input type="checkbox"
      onClick="cmdInit.disabled=!this.checked"><small>Yes I want to do this</small></p>
<? endif; ?>
</form>
