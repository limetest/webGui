$parity_help = <<<EOT
An unRAID disk array consists of a single Parity disk and a number of Data disks. The Data
disks are exclusively used to store user data, and the Parity disk provides the redundancy necessary
to recover from any singe disk failure.  Since data is not striped across the array, the Parity
disk must be as larger, or larger than the largest Data disk.  Parity should also be your highest
performance drive.
EOT;

$disk_help = <<<EOT
Data disks are used to store your data.  Each disk has it's own file system and can be exported as a
separate share.  Click on the Disk name to configure individual Data disk settings.
EOT;

$cache_help = <<<EOT
The Cache disk is a device *outside* the unRAID array.  It may be exported for network access just
like the Array disks.  Being outside the unRAID array results in significantly faster write access
at the cost of no data protection - if the Cache device fails all data contained on it may be lost.

When [User Shares](/Settings/ShareSettingsMenu) are enabled, user shares may be configured to
automatically make use of the Cache disk in order to
speed up writes.  A special background process called the *mover* can be scheduled to run
periodically to move user share files off the Cache disk and onto the Array.
EOT;

$totals_help = <<<EOT
The **Total** line provides a tally of the array device statistics, including the average temperature
of your hard drives.
EOT;

$unassigned_help = <<<EOT
Unassigned disks, indicated by **+++**, are devices installed in your server but not assigned any role,
and are not managed in any way by unRAID OS.
EOT;

$flash_help = <<<EOT
Vital array configuration is maintained on the USB Flash device; for this reason, it must remain
plugged in to your server.  Click on [Flash](/Main/Flash?name=flash) to see the GUID and registration
information, and
to configure export settings.  Since the USB Flash device is formatted using FAT file system, it
may only be exported using SMB protocol.

> **Identification** is the *signature* that uniquely identifies a storage device. The signature

> **Temp.** (temperature) is read directly from the drive.  You configure which units to use on
> the [Display Preferences](Settings/Display) page.  We don't read the temperature of spun-down hard
> drives since this typically causes them to spin up; instead we display an `*` symbol.  We also
> display an `*` symbol for SSD and Flash devices, though sometimes `0` will be displayed for these
> device types.

> **Size, Used, Free** reports the total disk size, used space, and remaining space for files.  These
> units are also configured on the [Display Preferences](Settings/Display) page.  The
> amount of space used will be non-zero even for an empty disk due to file system overhead.

> **Reads, Writes** are a count of I/O requests sent to the disk I/O drivers.  These statistics may
> be cleared at any time, refer to the Array Status section below.

> **Errors** counts the number of *unrecoverable* errors reported by the disk
> I/O drivers. Missing data due to unrecoverable read errors is filled in on-the-fly using parity
> reconstruct (and we attempt to write this data back to the sector(s) which failed). Any unrecoverable

> #### Assigning Devices
>
> An unRAID disk array consists of a single parity disk and a number of data disks. The data
> disks are exclusively used to store user data, and the parity disk provides the redundancy necessary
> to recover from any singe disk failure.
> 
> Note that we're careful to use the term *disk* when referring to an array storage device.  We
> use the term *hard drive* (or sometimes just *drive*) when referring to an actual hard disk drive (HDD)
> device. This is because in a RAID system it's possible to read/write an array disk whose corresponding
> hard drive is disabled or even missing! In addition, it's useful to be able to ask, "which device is
> assigned to be the parity disk?"; or, "which device corresponds to disk2?".
> 
> We therefore need a way to assign hard drives to array disks. This is accomplished here on the
> Main page when the array is stopped. There is a drop-down box for each array disk which lists all the
> unassigned devices. To assign a device simply select it from the list. Each time a device
> assignment is made, the system updates a configuration file to record the assignment.
> 
> #### Requirements
> 
> Unlike traditional RAID systems which stripe data across all the array devices, an unRAID server
> stores files on individual hard drives. Consequently, all file write operations will involve both the
> data disk the file is being written to, and the parity disk. For these reasons,
> 
> * the parity disk size must be as large or larger than any of the data disks,
> 
> and
> 
> * given a choice, the parity disk should be the fastest disk in your collection.
> 
> #### Guidelines
> 
> Here are the steps you should follow when designing your unRAID disk array:
> 
> 1. Decide which hard drive you will use for parity, and which hard drives you will use for
> data disk1, disk2, etc., and label them in some fashion. Also, find the serial number of each hard
> drive and jot it down somewhere; you will need this information later.
> 
> 2. Install your hard drive devices, boot unRAID Server and bring up the webGui. If this is a fresh system
> build, then the Main page will show no disks installed. This doesn't mean the system can't detect your
> hard drives; it just means that none have been assigned yet.
> 
> 3. Remember the serial numbers you recored back in step 1? For parity and each data disk, select the
> proper hard drive based on it's serial number from the drop down list.
>
> #### Hot Plug
>
> You may also *hot plug* hard drives into your server if your hardware supports it. For example,
> if you are using hard drive cages, you may simply plug them into your server while powered on and
> with array Stopped. Refresh the Main page to have new unassigned devices appear in the assignment
> dropdown lists.
> 
> #### Next Steps
>
> Once you have assigned all of your hard drives, refer to the Array Status section below
> and Start the array.
